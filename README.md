# Re-isotropic Segmentation for Subcellular Ultrastructure in Anisotropic EM Images

ReIsoSeg is a novel 3D segmentation framework aimed at overcoming the anisotropic problem in the segmentation of subcellular ultrastructure in electron microscopy (EM). Its main approach is to make it isotropic by achieving continuous consistency along different axes of features, thereby generating better features and enhancing the segmentation performance of the model.
